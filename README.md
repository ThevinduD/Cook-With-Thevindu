# Cook-With-Thevindu

## Overview

This is a recipe-generating app. You can add ingredients and generate a recipe based on the provided ingredients. It is built using the ReactJS framework and utilizes Mistral AI through the Hugging Face API to generate recipes.

## Installation
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThevinduD/Cook-With-Thevindu.git
cd Cook-With-Thevindu
npm install
npm start
```

### Note :
If the recipe response is not generating, it’s probably due to token expiration. I used a free plan, which has a limited number of responses it can generate. You can create your own Hugging Face API token, add it to the .env file, and you’re all set. Enjoy!
